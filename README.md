How much money do I actually have?

### To get going...
This is a spring boot application written in kotlin.
Using maven for dependency management.
It's using Mongo as its DB.

So on whatever platform install...
- Java
- Maven
- Kotlin Compiler
- Mongo (the docker default image works fine)
    - Docker pull mongo 
    
Then to actually run

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run

```
